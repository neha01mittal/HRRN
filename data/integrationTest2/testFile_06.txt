2008
Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of

Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big

commissioners
in

and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

Kansas

Kansas
began
its
2007
football
season
unregarded
and
without
much
consideration
from
the
national
media.
In
the
opening
Associated
Press
football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.

Orange
Bowl
The
2008
FedEx
Orange
Bowl
was
a
post-season
college
football
bowl
game
between
the
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
on
January
3,
2008,
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
Spread
bettors
favored
Virginia
Tech
by
three
points,
but
in
a
game
dominated
by
defensive
and
special
teams
play,
Kansas
defeated
Virginia
Tech
24–21.
The
game
was
part
of
the
2007–2008
Bowl
Championship
Series
(BCS)
of
the
2007
NCAA
Division
I
FBS
football
season
and
was
the
concluding
game
of
the
season
for
both
teams.
This
74th
edition
of
the
Orange
Bowl
was
televised
in
the
United
States
on
FOX
and
was
watched
by
more
than
eight
million
viewers.

The
game
between
the
third-ranked
ACC
champion
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
and
the
eighth-ranked
Kansas
Jayhawks
from
the
Big
12
Conference
(Big
12)
was
played
at
neutral-site
Dolphins
Stadium.
Tech
served
as
the
home
team
in
the
contest.
Virginia
Tech
automatically
qualified
for
the
Orange
Bowl
by
virtue
of
the
ACC's
tie-in
with
the
bowl,
while
Orange
Bowl
selected
Kansas
over
West
Virginia—which
had
been
upset
by
then
4–7
Pittsburgh—and
conference
rival
Missouri.
Two
weeks
after
Kansas's
selection,
controversy
erupted
when
a
deal
was
revealed
to
put
4th-ranked
Oklahoma
against
Virginia
Tech.
The
deal
was
vetoed
by
BCS
commissioners,
and
the
selection
of
Kansas
was
upheld.

The
game
marked
the
first
time
the
Jayhawks
had
been
to
the
Orange
Bowl
since
the
1969
Orange
Bowl
and
was
their
first
bowl
game
since
the
2005
Fort
Worth
Bowl,
when
they
defeated
Houston
41–13.
Virginia
Tech
last
played
in
the
Orange
Bowl
game
in
December
1996,
losing
to
Nebraska
21–41.
The
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
Virginia
Tech's
15th
consecutive
season
with
a
bowl
game,
a
streak
dating
to
the
1993
Independence
Bowl.

Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
completed
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards,
one
touchdown,
and
one
interception.
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ball,
Virginia
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
finished
the
game
13
for
28
passing,
earning
160
yards,
one
touchdown
and
two
interceptions.
Kansas
cornerback
Aqib
Talib,
whose
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
gave
Kansas
its
first
lead
of
the
game,
won
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player
award.
After
the
game,
Talib
was
one
of
several
players
from
both
teams
to
announce
an
intention
to
enter
the
2008
NFL
Draft.

Team
selection


As
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Conference,
Virginia
Tech
was
awarded
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[3]
The
automatic
ACC
bid
was
the
result
of
an
off-season
deal
following
the
inaugural
ACC
Championship
Game
which
granted
the
winner
of
the
ACC
Championship
Game
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
unless
it
was
ranked
high
enough
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
standings
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game.[4]

Virginia
Tech

The
Virginia
Tech
Hokies
began
their
2007
football
season
with
emotion
and
remembrance.
As
Virginia
Tech
recovered
from
the
worst
school
shooting
in
American
history,
football
served
as
a
way
to
help
the
university
community
emotionally
heal.[5]
The
opening
game
of
the
season,
on
September
1,
2007,
was
against
East
Carolina
University
and
featured
numerous
remembrance
ceremonies
and
commemorations.
Buoyed
by
the
emotion
of
the
day,
the
Hokies
earned
a
17–7
victory.[6]
Their
next
game
would
not
be
as
easy.
One
week
later,
Virginia
Tech
traveled
to
Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana
to
face
the
No.
2
Louisiana
State
University
Tigers.
The
Tigers
were
widely
regarded
in
pre-season
polls
as
favorites
to
play
in
the
National
Championship
Game
and
overwhelmed
the
Hokies
in
front
of
a
home
crowd,
48–7.[7]

In
the
wake
of
the
Hokies's
defeat,
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
start
a
new
quarterback
and
a
new
offensive
plan.
Behind
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor,
the
Hokies
rolled
to
five
straight
victories,
including
a
win
over
No.
22
Clemson
by
18
points.[8]
During
the
winning
streak,
Sean
Glennon,
who
had
started
at
quarterback
for
the
Hokies
during
the
first
two
games
of
the
season,
returned
to
alternate
possessions
with
Taylor
in
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system.
On
October
25,
the
Hokies
had
a
chance
to
make
up
for
their
early-season
loss
to
LSU
when
they
faced
No.
2
Boston
College
on
a
Thursday
night
in
Blacksburg,
Virginia.
Though
the
Hokies
dominated
for
most
of
the
game,
Boston
College
quarterback
Matt
Ryan
managed
a
late-game
comeback
to
win
the
game
14–10
with
11
seconds
remaining.[9]

With
four
consecutive
victories
after
the
loss,
including
a
win
over
then-No.
16
Virginia,
the
Hokies
won
the
Coastal
division
and
secured
a
bid
to
the
2007
ACC
Championship
Game
in
Jacksonville,
Florida.[10]
There,
they
faced
a
rematch
with
Boston
College,
champions
of
the
Atlantic
Division.
As
in
the
previous
matchup,
defense
dominated,
but
unlike
in
the
earlier
matchup,
Matt
Ryan
was
unable
to
seize
the
victory.
Two
fourth-quarter
interceptions
by
Virginia
Tech
sealed
the
Hokie
win
and
an
automatic
bid
to
the
Orange
Bowl
game.[11]

football
poll
of
the
2007
season,
Kansas
did
not
receive
a
single
vote.[12]
From
their
opening
game
of
the
year,
however,
the
Jayhawks
began
to
impress
voters
with
their
offensive
efficiency.
Against
Mid-American
Conference
Champion
Central
Michigan
University,
Kansas
scored
52
points
while
only
allowing
a
single
touchdown.[13]

Over
the
next
three
games,
Kansas
outscored
its
opponents
162–16.[14]
As
Kansas's
Big
12
schedule
began,
the
Jayhawks'
winning
ways
continued,
as
they
proved
themselves
against
legitimate
competition.
On
October
6,
Kansas
traveled
to
Manhattan,
Kansas,
home
of
then-ranked
No.
24
Kansas
State
University
for
the
opening
game
of
its
Big
12
schedule.[15]
In
front
of
50,924
hostile
fans,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
struggled
for
the
first
time
in
the
season.[16]
Late
in
the
fourth
quarter,
Reesing
threw
a
ball
that
bounced
off
the
facemask
of
wide
receiver
Dexton
Fields
before
being
intercepted.
The
interception
set
up
a
Kansas
State
touchdown
that
put
Kansas
into
a
24–21
hole
with
seven
and
a
half
minutes
remaining.
Reesing
and
the
Jayhawks
struck
back
quickly,
however,
and
scored
a
30-yard
touchdown
to
take
the
lead
for
good.[16]

With
the
win,
Kansas
broke
into
the
rankings
of
the
top
25
college
football
teams
in
the
country
for
the
first
time
since
1996,[17]
entering
the
AP
Poll
at
No.
20.[18]
Over
the
next
six
weeks,
Kansas
continued
to
find
ways
to
win.
Traditional
Jayhawk
rivals
such
as
Nebraska,
Oklahoma
State,
and
Texas
A&M
were
defeated
during
the
course
of
the
season,
and
Kansas
climbed
the
national
rankings.
By
the
13th
week
of
the
season,
the
stage
had
been
set
for
an
epic
game
against
Kansas's
traditional
rival,
Missouri.[19]

Due
to
prior
agreement,
the
2007
edition
of
the
Border
War
was
held
in
Kansas
City,
Missouri,
at
Arrowhead
Stadium,
home
of
the
National
Football
League's
Kansas
City
Chiefs.[19]
In
front
of
over
80,000
fans,
No.
4
Missouri
defeated
No.
2
Kansas
36–28
to
hand
the
Jayhawks
their
first
loss
of
the
season.[19]
Missouri,
with
the
win,
earned
a
trip
to
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.
In
that
game,
Oklahoma
defeated
Missouri
38–17
to
earn
an
automatic
bid
to
the
2008
Fiesta
Bowl.[20]
Because
the
loss
gave
Missouri
its
second
of
the
year,
Kansas,
which
lost
to
the
Tigers,
was
selected
as
an
at-large
pick
by
the
BCS
and
earned
a
trip
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[21][22]

Controversy

Although
Virginia
Tech's
selection
via
automatic
bid
was
relatively
quiet,
Kansas'
selection
caused
a
great
deal
of
controversy.
Kansas
had
lost
to
Big
12
runner-up
Missouri
and
had
a
lower
Bowl
Championship
Poll
ranking
than
the
Tigers.[23]
Some
believed
that
Missouri
should
have
been
selected
ahead
of
Kansas
because
they
had
defeated
Kansas
and
because
they
had
played
in
the
Big
12
Championship
Game.[23]
According
to
BCS
officials,
however,
Missouri's
two
losses
were
more
of
a
detriment
than
Kansas's
one
loss
and
subsequent
championship
game
absence.[23]

Pundits
and
fans
who
opposed
Kansas'
selection
pointed
to
the
Jayhawks'
strength
of
schedule,
which
at
one
point
during
the
season
was
as
low
as
109th
out
of
119
Division
I
teams.[24]
By
the
time
of
the
BCS
selection,
however,
Kansas's
strength
of
schedule
had
climbed
by
a
small
amount,
reaching
88th
in
the
Sagarin
rankings
and
74th
in
the
CBS
rankings.[25]
The
final
rankings
rated
Kansas'
schedule
as
more
difficult
than
Hawaii,
which
was
also
selected
to
play
in
the
BCS.[25]
Aggravating
the
situation
was
the
fact
that
Kansas
and
Missouri
had
one
of
the
most
intense
rivalries
in
college
football.
Known
as
the
Border
War,
the
roots
of
the
rivalry
dated
to
the
years
before
the
American
Civil
War.[26]

Two
weeks
after
the
selection
of
Kansas,
yet
another
controversy
arose
when
it
was
revealed
that
Big
12
and
ACC
officials
had
worked
out
an
agreement
to
feature
an
Oklahoma/Virginia
Tech
matchup
in
the
Orange
Bowl
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
the
final
selection.[27]
Oklahoma,
which
initiated
the
proposal,
requested
that
it
face
the
highest-ranked
BCS
opponent
then
available,
which
would
have
been
Virginia
Tech
(ranked
3rd
in
the
BCS).
Normally,
Oklahoma,
the
2007
Big
12
Champion,
would
have
played
in
the
Fiesta
Bowl,
which
holds
the
automatic
rights
to
the
Big
12
Champion's
BCS
bid.
A
little-known
clause
in
the
Bowl
Championship
Series
contract,
however,
allows
for
the
commissioners
of
the
BCS
to
override
that
bid
if
the
automatically
selected
team
had
played
in
the
game
the
previous
year,
or
to
create
a
more
interesting
matchup.
Oklahoma
had
played
in
the
2007
Fiesta
Bowl
and
seemed
a
perfect
candidate
for
execution
of
the
clause.[27]
Representatives
from
the
Orange
and
Fiesta
bowls
reportedly
worked
out
a
deal
to
swap
Oklahoma
and
Kansas
and
Dan
Beebe,
the
commissioner
from
the
Big
12,
presented
the
plan
to
the
BCS
committee.
The
remaining
BCS
commissioners
rejected
the
request
(with
only
the
Big
12,
ACC
and
Big
East
commissioners
in
favor)
and
honored
the
original
selection
of
Kansas
for
the
Orange
Bowl
and
forced
Oklahoma
to
accept
its
automatic
Fiesta
Bowl
Bid.[27]
The
release
of
this
plan
upset
many
fans
at
both
schools
and
across
the
country,
who
perceived
that
an
(4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia
Tech
matchup
would
have
been
superior
to
a
(8)Kansas-(3)Virginia
Tech
game.[28]
Ironically,
while
Oklahoma-Virginia
Tech
was
perceived
as
a
better
match-up
due
to
their
high
rankings,
both
teams
went
on
to
be
upset
by
the
lower
ranked
team
with
Oklahoma
losing
48-28
to
(9)West
Virginia.

Pregame
buildup


Most
pre-game
media
and
popular
coverage
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
focused
on
the
matchup
between
Kansas's
No.
2
scoring
offense
and
Virginia
Tech's
No.
2
scoring
defense.[29]
Outside
factors,
such
as
coaching,
previous
experience,
and
fan
support
were
also
considered
in
pre-game
analysis
of
the
matchup.
Outside
story
lines
included
Virginia
Tech's
recovery
from
the
Virginia
Tech
Massacre,
recovery
from
late-season
losses
suffered
by
each
team
(against
Missouri
for
Kansas
and
against
Boston
College
for
Virginia
Tech).[30]

Offensive
matchups

Kansas

Heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
Kansas
was
ranked
second
in
the
nation
in
scoring
(44.3)
and
sixth
in
yards
per
game
(491).[31]
Kansas
scored
40
or
more
points
eight
times
during
the
2007
season
and
scored
50
points
five
times.[32]
Kansas's
ground
game
was
led
by
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
averaged
87.5
yards
per
game
during
the
2007
season
and
earned
1,050
yards
and
16
touchdowns
in
the
season
leading
to
the
Orange
Bowl.[32]
Through
the
air,
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
earned
the
11th-highest
passer
rating
in
the
country,
averaging
a
152.41
quarterback
rating
in
2007.[32]
Reesing
completed
62.6%
of
his
passes
during
the
2007
season,
earning
3,259
yards,
32
touchdowns,
and
just
six
interceptions.[33]
Reesing's
favorite
receiver
was
Marcus
Henry,
who
was
ranked
No.
29
in
the
country
for
passing
yardage,
averaging
over
82
receiving
yards
per
game.
During
2007,
Henry
earned
994
yards
and
nine
touchdowns.[32]
On
the
offensive
line,
the
Jayhawks
were
led
by
All-American
left
tackle
Anthony
Collins,
who
finished
as
a
finalist
for
the
Outland
Trophy,
awarded
to
college
football's
best
offensive
lineman.[34]
Because
of
the
Jayhawks'
effectiveness
on
offense,
they
punted
the
ball
just
46
times
during
the
2007
season,
the
seventh-lowest
total
in
Division
I.[35]

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
featured
an
unusual
two-quarterback
system
on
offense,
as
quarterbacks
Sean
Glennon
and
Tyrod
Taylor
shared
time
behind
center.
Though
unusual,
the
system
was
successful
in
leading
the
Hokies
to
their
second
ACC
Championship
in
four
years.
During
the
2007
regular
season,
Glennon
threw
for
1,636
yards
and
11
touchdowns,
completing
63
percent
of
his
passes.
Taylor,
meanwhile,
passed
for
916
yards
and
five
touchdowns
while
also
rushing
for
431
yards.[36]
Some
pundits
predicted
that
Kansas
might
have
difficulty
with
Taylor's
mobility,
as
his
style
of
play
was
similar
to
that
of
Missouri's
Chase
Daniel,
who
gave
Kansas
its
sole
loss
of
the
2007
season.[24]
On
the
other
end
of
the
Virginia
Tech
aerial
offense
was
a
corps
of
capable
receivers,
led
by
senior
wide
receivers
Eddie
Royal
and
Josh
Morgan.
Morgan
was
the
fifth-ranked
receiver
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
having
earned
1,787
receiving
yards.
Royal
was
sixth,
having
earned
1,767
yards.
Two
of
Tech's
other
receivers,
Josh
Hyman
and
Justin
Harper,
recorded
1,138
and
1,274
receiving
yards
each,
marking
the
first
time
in
Virginia
Tech
history
that
the
Hokies
had
four
different
thousand-yard
career
receivers
on
the
same
team.[36]
On
the
ground,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
running
back
Branden
Ore,
who
rushed
for
876
yards
and
eight
touchdowns
during
the
regular
season.
One
week
before
the
Orange
Bowl,
Tech
coaches
revealed
that
Ore
would
be
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
game
against
Kansas
as
punishment
for
showing
up
late
to
the
Hokies'
final
pre-bowl
practice.
Ore
was
replaced
by
sophomore
rusher
Kenny
Lewis
Jr.[37]

Defensive
matchups

Virginia
Tech

Virginia
Tech
finished
the
season
ranked
second
nationally
in
points
allowed
per
game
(15.5)
and
fourth
nationally
in
yardage
allowed
(293).[31]
The
Hokies
didn't
allow
a
fourth-quarter
point
in
the
five
games
after
giving
up
14
fourth-quarter
points
to
Boston
College
in
Blacksburg.
One
key
player
in
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
linebacker
Xavier
Adibi,
who
had
scored
his
third
career
defensive
touchdown
in
the
ACC
Championship
Game
against
Boston
College.
Adibi,
together
with
fellow
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
made
up
"the
best
LB
duo
in
the
country,"
according
to
ESPN
commentator
Chris
Spielman.
Hall's
effectiveness
had,
however,
been
limited
in
the
2007
season
by
a
broken
wrist
suffered
against
Clemson.
Hall
missed
four
games
with
the
injury,
but
returned
to
play
the
final
three
contests
of
the
season
for
Virginia
Tech
and
promised
to
be
featured
heavily
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl.[36]
Backing
up
the
Virginia
Tech
linebackers
was
a
strong
backfield,
which
had
produced
12
NFL
draft
picks
in
the
nine
years
preceding
the
2007
season.
Primary
among
the
backfield
players
were
cornerbacks
Victor
Harris
and
Brandon
Flowers,
who
Sports
Illustrated.com
called
"maybe
the
best
cornerback
duo
in
the
country".[36]

Kansas

Kansas,
meanwhile,
was
less-highly
regarded
on
defense
and
came
into
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
ranked
57th
nationally
in
pass
defense.[33]
On
the
ground,
however,
Kansas
was
ranked
far
higher—sixth
in
the
nation.
In
addition,
Kansas
only
allowed
an
average
of
16
points
per
game,
good
enough
for
to
be
ranked
fourth
nationally.[33]
A
key
portion
of
that
run
defense
was
defensive
tackle
James
McClinton,
who
was
named
the
Big
12's
Defensive
Lineman
of
the
Year
and
earned
second-team
All-America
honors.
McClinton
finished
the
2007
regular
season
with
10.5
tackles
for
loss
and
promised
more
of
the
same
for
the
Orange
Bowl.[33]
The
team
captain
of
the
Jayhawk
defense,
meanwhile,
was
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib.[38]
Talib
was
also
a
threat
on
offense,
catching
eight
passes,
including
four
touchdowns,
during
the
regular
season.[39]

Game
summary



The
2008
Orange
Bowl
kicked
off
at
8:30
p.m.
EST
at
Dolphins
Stadium
in
Miami
Gardens,
Florida.
The
official
attendance
for
the
game
was
listed
as
74,111
(the
eighth
consecutive
Orange
Bowl
sellout),[40]
but
actual
attendance
was
lower,
and
several
upper-deck
sections
of
the
stadium
were
sparsely
filled.[41]
Approximately
15
million
viewers
watched
the
game,
earning
the
broadcast
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.4.[42]
The
broadcast
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
the
only
BCS
bowl
game
to
show
a
rise
in
television
viewers
over
the
previous
season's
broadcast,
as
the
2007
Orange
Bowl
had
only
earned
a
Nielsen
rating
of
7.0.[43]
The
pre-game
show
featured
several
high
school
marching
bands,
and
the
national
anthem
was
sung
by
American
Idol
runner-up
Katharine
McPhee.[44]

The
coin
toss
featured
former
Virginia
Tech
star
Bruce
Smith,
while
Kansas
was
represented
by
Gale
Sayers.[41]
Kansas
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
defer
its
choice
until
the
second
half.
Virginia
Tech
chose
to
receive
the
ball
to
start
the
game.
Kansas
would
receive
the
ball
to
begin
the
second
half.
At
kickoff,
the
air
temperature
was
unseasonably
cold
for
Miami
at
57
°F
(14
°C),
and
the
skies
were
cloudy
with
intermittent
rain.[40][45]

First
quarter


Virginia
Tech's
Eddie
Royal
fielded
the
opening
kickoff
from
Kansas
kicker
Scott
Webb,
returning
it
59
yards
to
the
41-yard
line
of
Kansas.
The
return
gave
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
excellent
field
position
to
begin
the
game.
Tech
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
first
down
on
the
opening
play
of
the
game,
but
Kansas'
defense
stiffened
on
subsequent
plays.
After
Virginia
Tech's
Tyrod
Taylor
entered
the
game
at
quarterback,
Kansas
sacked
Taylor
twice,
pushing
Virginia
Tech
19
yards
backward,
out
of
field
goal
range.
Because
of
the
sacks,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
without
scoring
any
points.[46]

The
punt
was
downed
in
the
end
zone
for
a
touchback,
and
Kansas
began
its
first
offensive
possession
of
the
game
at
its
20-yard
line.
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing
proved
remarkably
effective,
completing
six
of
his
eight
passes
during
the
drive
and
rushing
for
five
yards
on
a
quarterback
scramble.
Reesing
drove
Kansas'
offense
into
Virginia
Tech
territory,
but
after
Tech's
Orion
Martin
sacked
Reesing,
Kansas
was
unable
to
gain
another
first
down
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
sent
into
the
game
to
attempt
a
44-yard
field
goal.
Webb's
kick
sailed
wide
of
the
uprights,
however,
and
the
game
remained
scoreless
with
6:44
remaining
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

After
the
missed
field
goal,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
own
27-yard
line.
Running
back
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.,
replacing
the
suspended
Branden
Ore,
ran
for
a
first
down,
and
Tyrod
Taylor
connected
on
an
11-yard
pass
to
Eddie
Royal
for
another
first
down.
Now
inside
Kansas
territory,
Taylor
attempted
another
pass.
Kansas
All-American
cornerback
Aqib
Talib
jumped
between
Taylor's
throw
and
the
receiver,
intercepting
the
ball.
Talib
returned
the
interception
60
yards
to
the
end
zone
for
a
Kansas
touchdown—the
first
points
of
the
game.
An
extra
point
kick
by
Scott
Webb
made
the
score
7–0
Kansas
with
5:15
remaining
in
the
quarter.[46]

High-stepping
into
the
endzone,
Aqib
Talib
committed
a
15-yard
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalty,
which
was
enforced
on
the
post-score
kickoff.
The
penalty,
coupled
with
a
good
kick
return
by
Virginia
Tech,
gave
the
Hokies
excellent
field
position
for
their
third
possession
of
the
game.
Quarterback
Sean
Glennon
capitalized
on
that
field
position,
connecting
on
a
24-yard
pass
to
wide
receiver
Justin
Harper.
The
catch
pushed
Virginia
Tech
inside
Kansas
territory
and
seemingly
set
up
the
Hokie
offense
for
their
first
score
of
the
game.
After
two
plays
for
no
gain
and
a
five-yard
loss
when
Glennon
was
sacked
by
James
Holt,
Virginia
Tech
was
forced
to
attempt
a
49-yard
field
goal.
Jud
Dunlevy's
kick
fell
short,
however,
and
Virginia
Tech
was
denied
a
score.
Kansas
recovered
the
short
kick,
which
landed
in
the
end
zone,
and
returned
the
ball
39
yards.
Despite
the
momentum
earned
by
the
missed
kick,
Kansas
went
three
plays
without
gaining
a
first
down
and
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away.
Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
ball
at
its
15-yard
line
and
ran
two
plays
before
time
ran
out
in
the
first
quarter.[46]

At
the
end
of
the
first
quarter,
Kansas
had
kept
Virginia
Tech
scoreless
while
capitalizing
on
a
60-yard
interception
return
by
Aqib
Talib
for
the
game's
only
points,
a
7–0
lead.[46]

Second
quarter

Virginia
Tech
began
the
second
quarter
in
possession
of
the
ball
and
facing
a
third-and-five
from
its
own
20-yard
line.
On
the
first
play
of
the
quarter,
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
threw
for
the
first
down,
but
was
intercepted
at
the
37-yard
line
by
Kansas'
Chris
Harris.
After
the
interception,
Kansas
had
the
ball
at
the
Virginia
Tech
31-yard
line.
Todd
Reesing
connected
on
a
first-down
pass
to
Derek
Fine,
and
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson
contributed
several
short
rushes.
The
Kansas
offense
failed
to
gain
a
second
first
down
after
the
interception,
however,
and
kicker
Scott
Webb
was
again
called
upon
to
attempt
a
field
goal,
this
time
from
32
yards
away.
Unlike
his
first
kick,
the
second
sailed
through
the
uprights
for
three
points.
With
12
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
quarter,
Kansas
extended
its
lead
to
10–0.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-field
goal
kickoff
at
its
own
31-yard
line,
and
Branden
Ore,
having
entered
the
game
after
his
one-quarter
suspension,
advanced
the
ball
three
yards.
Quarterback
Tyrod
Taylor
also
advanced
the
ball
five
yards
on
a
scramble,
but
failed
to
gain
a
first
down.
The
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
and
Kansas
recovered
the
kick
at
its
41-yard
line.
With
good
field
position
and
momentum
granted
by
the
interception
and
field
goal,
Kansas
moved
the
ball
quickly.
Todd
Reesing
was
sacked
by
Nekos
Brown
and
Xavier
Adibi,
but
connected
to
Jake
Sharp
for
20
yards
on
two
passes,
advancing
the
ball
deep
into
Virginia
Tech
territory.
Passes
to
Marcus
Henry
and
Dezmon
Briscoe
advanced
Kansas
21
more
yards
into
Hokie
territory,
and
Brandon
McAnderson
rushed
for
five
yards
on
the
ground.
Capping
the
Kansas
drive
was
a
13-yard
toss
by
Reesing
to
Henry
for
a
touchdown.
The
score,
which
came
with
7:03
remaining
in
the
first
half,
gave
Kansas
a
17–0
lead,
its
largest
of
the
game.[47]

Virginia
Tech
recovered
the
post-touchdown
kickoff
desperately
needing
to
score
before
halftime.
Kansas
had
played
strongly
on
defense
throughout
the
first
half,
and
the
game's
momentum
was
firmly
behind
the
Jayhawks,
who
had
capitalized
on
two
Virginia
Tech
turnovers.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
three-yard
pass
to
Josh
Morgan
to
begin
the
drive,
but
it
was
running
back
Branden
Ore
who
did
the
vast
majority
of
the
work
during
the
Hokies'
final
offensive
drive
of
the
first
half.
After
Glennon's
pass,
Ore
rushed
the
ball
on
six
straight
plays,
picking
up
33
yards
and
two
first
downs
on
the
way.
After
that,
Glennon
contributed
a
five-yard
run
of
his
own,
which
was
aided
by
a
15-yard
facemask
penalty
against
Kansas.
Branden
Ore
received
the
ball
again,
rushing
on
five
consecutive
plays,
culminating
in
a
one-yard
run
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
came
with
just
1:03
left
in
the
half,
giving
Virginia
Tech
its
first
points
of
the
game
and
narrowing
Kansas'
lead
to
17–7.[47]

Kansas
received
Virginia
Tech's
kickoff,
and
the
Hokies
attempted
to
give
themselves
another
chance
at
offense
by
calling
timeouts
after
Kansas
rushed
the
ball.
The
timeouts
stopped
the
clock,
but
Kansas
managed
to
earn
a
first
down
and
run
out
the
clock
after
Tech
used
its
allotted
three
timeouts.
Heading
into
halftime,
Kansas
still
had
the
lead
and
the
momentum,
but
a
Virginia
Tech
touchdown
had
cut
the
Jayhawks'
lead
to
just
10
points,
17–7.[47]

Halftime
show

The
halftime
show
of
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
was
headlined
by
American
blues
rock
band
ZZ
Top,
who
played
their
song
Sharp
Dressed
Man.[48]
The
band
was
a
favorite
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing,
who
expressed
regrets
prior
to
the
game
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
listen
to
the
performance.[49]
The
Master
of
Ceremonies
for
the
show
was
local
disc
jockey
DJ
Irie,
who
orchestrated
a
cheering
contest
between
fans
of
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas.
Irie
became
the
first
DJ
to
perform
in
the
halftime
show
of
a
bowl
game
in
2005
when
he
played
during
halftime
at
the
2005
Orange
Bowl.[50]
Also
featured
during
the
halftime
show
were
a
group
of
high
school
marching
bands,
who
played
Stevie
Ray
Vaughan's
Crossfire
while
ZZ
Top's
stage
was
disassembled.[51]
Following
the
halftime
show,
the
FOX
truck
broadcasting
the
game
experienced
a
power
outage.
As
Fox
crews
worked
to
get
the
power
restored,
the
second
half
was
delayed
by
three
minutes.[52][53]

Third
quarter

Kansas,
which
had
won
the
pre-game
coin
toss,
received
the
ball
to
open
the
second
half.
Todd
Reesing
initially
began
where
he
had
left
off
in
the
first
half,
completing
a
pass
to
Dexton
Fields
for
12
yards
and
a
first
down.
On
subsequent
plays,
however,
Virginia
Tech
showed
some
of
the
defensive
prowess
that
had
been
promoted
heavily
heading
into
the
game.
Aqib
Talib
was
tackled
for
a
loss
of
six
yards
after
catching
a
pass.
Reesing
was
sacked
under
heavy
pressure
from
the
Tech
defense.
On
third
down,
a
Reesing
pass
was
nearly
intercepted
by
Cody
Grimm,
who
knocked
it
down
to
force
a
Kansas
punt.
On
the
subsequent
return,
Virginia
Tech
earned
its
first
big
play
of
the
game.
Eddie
Royal,
who
had
returned
every
one
of
Virginia
Tech's
first-half
kicks,
received
the
ball
and
lateraled
it
to
Justin
Harper,
who
returned
it
84
yards
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points
with
11:35
remaining
in
the
third
quarter.[54]


With
the
game's
momentum
now
firmly
in
their
favor,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
stopped
Kansas'
offense
on
three
straight
plays,
forcing
another
Kansas
punt.
The
kick
traveled
62
yards
and
was
recovered
at
the
Virginia
Tech
18-yard
line.
Virginia
Tech's
offense,
despite
the
poor
field
position,
moved
quickly,
partly
due
to
a
15-yard
pass
interference
penalty
against
Kansas.
Sean
Glennon
completed
a
controversial
37-yard
pass
to
tight
end
Greg
Boone
to
drive
the
Hokies
deep
into
Kansas
territory.
Initially,
the
pass
appeared
to
have
been
intercepted
by
a
Kansas
defender,
but
subsequent
replays
revealed
that
Boone
had
wrested
possession
of
the
ball
away
from
the
defender.
Three
rushes
deep
inside
the
Kansas
red
zone
netted
the
Hokies
just
nine
more
yards,
setting
up
a
fourth-and-one
scenario
for
the
Virginia
Tech
offense.
Rather
than
risk
a
failed
fourth-down
conversion,
Virginia
Tech
head
coach
Frank
Beamer
sent
in
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
attempt
a
25-yard
field
goal.
During
the
kick,
however,
Kansas
defender
Joe
Mortensen
rushed
through
the
Virginia
Tech
line
and
blocked
the
kick,
denying
the
Hokies
three
points
and
preserving
a
17–14
Kansas
lead
with
6:31
remaining
in
the
quarter.[54]

The
block
neutralized
all
the
Virginia
Tech
momentum
that
had
been
gained
with
the
punt-return
touchdown
and
kept
Kansas
in
the
lead.[55]
After
the
block,
however,
Kansas
failed
to
gain
a
first
down
on
offense.
Though
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
punter
Kyle
Tucker's
42-yard
kick
was
helped
by
a
10-yard
illegal
blocking
penalty
against
Virginia
Tech
that
pinned
the
Hokies
at
their
own
25-yard
line.
Branden
Ore
picked
up
a
first
down
with
two
rushes,
but
the
Tech
offense
failed
to
gain
another
first
down
and
the
Hokies
were
forced
to
punt
the
ball
again.[54]

Kansas
took
over
at
its
own
12-yard
line
after
the
punt.
On
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
Reesing
completed
a
37-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
putting
the
ball
near
midfield.
Three
straight
incomplete
passes
later,
Kansas
faced
a
fourth-and-ten
and
a
punt.
Instead
of
punting
the
ball
away,
however,
Kansas
elected
to
try
a
risky
fake
punt-pass.
Instead
of
snapping
the
ball
to
the
punter,
the
ball
was
snapped
to
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
the
ball
22
yards
downfield
to
Micah
Brown
for
a
first
down.
On
the
very
next
play,
Reesing,
having
returned
to
the
field,
connected
on
a
28-yard
pass
to
Dexton
Fields,
who
was
pushed
out
of
bounds
just
short
of
the
goal
line.
With
a
first-and-goal
from
inside
the
one-yard
line,
a
Kansas
touchdown
seemed
inevitable.
On
the
first
play
inside
the
red
zone,
however,
Kansas
fumbled
the
ball.
Though
the
ball
was
recovered
by
a
Kansas
player,
the
play
lost
four
yards.
On
the
next
play,
Kansas
committed
a
15-yard
personal
foul
penalty.
The
personal
foul
was
followed
by
a
10-yard
holding
penalty,
and
Kansas
was
pushed
entirely
outside
the
Virginia
Tech
red
zone.
In
an
effort
to
push
back,
Reesing
threw
a
pass
deep
downfield.
Instead
of
being
completed,
however,
the
ball
was
intercepted
by
Virginia
Tech's
D.J.
Parker.
With
39
seconds
left
in
the
quarter,
Virginia
Tech
had
stopped
Kansas
from
gaining
a
point
despite
the
Jayhawks
penetrating
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
one-yard
line.[54]

As
the
quarter
came
to
an
end,
the
Hokies
gained
two
quick
first
downs
and
advanced
the
ball
26
yards,
seemingly
having
regained
the
momentum
lost
with
the
blocked
kick.
With
one
quarter
remaining
in
the
game,
however,
Kansas
still
had
a
three-point
lead,
17–14.[54]

Fourth
quarter


The
first
few
plays
of
the
fourth
quarter
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
that
had
been
shown
in
the
third
for
the
Hokies.
Two
incomplete
passes
and
one
that
gained
just
two
yards
forced
Virginia
Tech
to
punt
the
ball
away
with
13:49
remaining
in
the
quarter.
After
taking
over
at
its
33-yard
line,
Kansas
had
no
more
success
on
offense
than
did
Virginia
Tech.
After
three
straight
plays
with
no
gain,
Kansas
was
forced
to
punt
the
ball
away
as
well.
A
58-yard
kick
by
Kyle
Tucker
pinned
Virginia
Tech
inside
its
10-yard
line,
and
the
Hokies
were
unable
to
advance
the
ball
much
beyond
the
ten-yard
line.
An
incomplete
pass
and
a
two-yard
run
by
Branden
Ore
were
all
the
offense
managed
before
Sean
Glennon
threw
a
20-yard
interception
to
the
Jayhawks'
Justin
Thornton.
Thornton
returned
the
ball
30
yards
to
the
Virginia
Tech
two-yard
line,
and
on
Kansas'
first
play
after
the
interception,
Todd
Reesing
ran
two
yards
for
the
touchdown.
The
score
gave
the
Jayhawks
a
24–14
lead
with
just
10:57
remaining.[56]

After
the
Kansas
kickoff,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
at
its
33-yard
line.
Needing
a
score,
the
Hokies
committed
a
five-yard
false
start
penalty
before
quarterback
Sean
Glennon
was
sacked
by
Kansas'
Mike
Rivera.
The
two
plays
pushed
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
back,
preventing
them
from
gaining
a
first
down.
Forced
to
punt
the
ball
away,
Virginia
Tech
had
to
play
defense
as
Kansas
took
over
at
its
28-yard
line.
Secure
in
their
lead,
Kansas
elected
to
run
the
ball
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
clock
moving
and
bring
the
game
to
an
end
more
quickly.
Brandon
McAnderson
broke
free
for
28
yards
on
the
first
play
of
the
drive,
and
Jake
Sharp
contributed
another
first
down
on
the
ground
before
the
Hokie
defense
stopped
Kansas
on
an
attempt
to
earn
a
first
down
on
a
fourth-and-two
deep
inside
Virginia
Tech
territory.[56]


Having
stopped
Kansas
on
fourth
down,
Virginia
Tech
took
over
on
offense
at
its
22-yard
line.
With
just
5:51
remaining
in
the
game,
the
Hokies
badly
needed
to
score
quickly
and
get
a
defensive
stop
in
order
to
have
a
chance
to
win.
The
Hokies
advanced
on
the
first
aspect
of
that
requirement
as
Sean
Glennon
converted
several
first
downs
through
the
air.
Kansas
allowed
no
play
over
nine
yards
until
late
in
the
drive,
forcing
Virginia
Tech
to
use
up
valuable
time.
On
the
last
play
of
the
drive,
Sean
Glennon
connected
on
a
20-yard
strike
to
Justin
Harper
for
a
touchdown.
The
score
cut
Kansas'
lead
to
just
three
points,
but
with
just
three
minutes
remaining
in
the
game,
Virginia
Tech's
comeback
would
only
be
complete
if
the
Hokies
could
recover
a
difficult
onside
kick.[56]

Jud
Dunlevy
kicked
the
ball,
which
traveled
the
regulation
10
yards,
but
was
recovered
by
Kansas.
The
Hokies,
despite
failing
to
recover
the
onside
kick,
still
had
a
chance
for
another
offensive
possession
if
they
stopped
Kansas'
offense
short
of
a
first
down.
Because
the
Hokies
had
two
timeouts
remaining,
they
could
stop
the
clock
after
two
Kansas
plays,
thus
preserving
time
for
a
Virginia
Tech
offensive
drive.
An
11-yard
pass
by
Todd
Reesing
netted
Kansas
a
first
down,
however,
and
subsequent
runs
by
the
Jayhawks
allowed
Kansas
to
run
out
the
clock
despite
the
Virginia
Tech
timeouts.
Kansas
preserved
its
lead
by
kneeling
on
the
ball
inside
the
Virginia
Tech
5-yard
line
on
the
final
plays
of
the
game,
and
the
24–21
victory
was
celebrated
as
time
ran
out.[56]

Final
statistics

Kansas'
Aqib
Talib
was
named
the
game's
Most
Valuable
Player.
Talib's
60-yard
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
was
the
Orange
Bowl's
first
since
the
1968
Orange
Bowl,
when
Oklahoma's
Bob
Stephenson
performed
the
same
feat.[58]
When
he
appeared
on
stage
on
the
field
after
the
game
to
receive
his
award,
Talib
exclaimed,
"I
felt
like
Deion!",
a
reference
to
former
NFL
star
Deion
Sanders.[59]

The
two
teams
finished
with
extremely
similar
statistical
totals,
as
befitting
a
close
game.
The
two
teams
were
within
38
total
yards
of
each
other;
Kansas
had
344
yards
and
Virginia
Tech
had
306.[57]
That
relative
closeness
was
reflected
in
the
teams'
first-down
totals
as
well.
Virginia
Tech
earned
20
first
downs:
10
rushing,
eight
passing,
and
two
via
penalty.
Kansas,
meanwhile,
earned
19
first
downs:
five
rushing,
13
passing,
and
one
via
penalty.[57]

Over
two-thirds
of
Kansas'
offense
came
through
the
air
as
the
Jayhawks
racked
up
249
net
passing
yards.
The
Hokies,
meanwhile,
earned
almost
half
their
offense
on
the
ground.[57]
The
end
result
of
the
varying
offensive
strategies
was
much
the
same,
however.
Kansas
successfully
converted
six
of
its
17
third-down
attempts,
while
Virginia
Tech
converted
seven
of
its
17
attempts.
The
time
of
possession
was
one
key
stat
in
favor
of
Kansas,
as
Kansas
controlled
the
ball
for
33:47,
over
7
minutes
more
than
Virginia
Tech's
possession
time
of
26:13.[57]

The
difference
in
the
game
came
from
special
teams
and
turnovers.
Virginia
Tech
turned
the
ball
over
three
times,
while
Kansas
turned
the
ball
over
just
once.
Kansas
converted
its
three
takeaways
into
17
points,
giving
the
Jayhawks
an
enormous
advantage
on
the
scoreboard.
Virginia
Tech
failed
to
convert
its
sole
turnover
recovery
into
any
points.[60]

Virginia
Tech
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Hokies
largely
kept
up
with
the
Jayhawks,
despite
a
losing
effort.
The
two-quarterback
system
that
had
been
heavily
promoted
heading
into
the
game
was
largely
abandoned
in
the
first
quarter
after
freshman
Tyrod
Taylor
was
sacked
on
his
first
two
plays
and
threw
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
during
his
second
time
on
the
field.
After
those
two
abortive
first-quarter
appearances,
and
a
single
play
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter,
Taylor
did
not
re-enter
the
game
until
a
single
play
halfway
through
the
fourth
quarter.[62]
With
Taylor
largely
removed
from
the
game,
junior
Sean
Glennon
was
left
to
fill
the
gaps.
Glennon
had
a
solid,
if
unspectacular,
game,
completing
13
of
his
28
passes
for
160
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Glennon
did
struggle
at
times
against
the
Jayhawks'
defense,
however,
throwing
two
interceptions
that
resulted
in
10
Kansas
points.[62]

With
Glennon
behind
center,
the
Virginia
Tech
offense
utilized
several
different
wide
receivers
in
the
passing
game.
Eight
different
players
caught
at
least
one
pass,
and
the
leading
receiver,
Justin
Harper,
hauled
in
four
catches
for
64
yards
and
a
touchdown.[61]
Receiver
Josh
Morgan,
meanwhile,
caught
three
passes,
bringing
him
to
122
receptions
for
his
career,
passing
Antonio
Freeman
for
second
place
all-time
at
Virginia
Tech.[36]
Ernest
Wilford
remains
first
in
the
Virginia
Tech
record
book,
with
126
receptions.[63]

The
Hokies
were
slightly
more
effective
rushing
the
ball.
In
the
ground
game,
seven
different
players
carried
the
ball
at
least
once,
netting
135
rushing
yards.
Branden
Ore
finished
the
game
with
116
yards,[61]
leading
all
rushers
on
both
teams.
That
total
put
him
just
eight
yards
short
of
his
second-straight
1,000-yard
season.
Ore's
total
is
even
more
impressive
when
one
considers
that
he
had
been
suspended
for
the
entire
first
quarter
of
the
game,
his
place
taken
by
backup
rusher
Kenny
Lewis,
Jr.
Lewis
finished
the
game
with
four
carries
for
22
yards,[61]
and
did
not
see
much
action
after
Ore
entered
the
game
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
quarter.[62]

On
special
teams,
the
Hokies
had
several
highs
and
lows.
Justin
Harper's
84-yard
punt-return
touchdown
sparked
a
Virginia
Tech
rally
that
brought
the
Hokies
within
striking
distance,
but
failures
on
special
teams
also
ended
the
rally
and
turned
the
momentum
of
the
game
against
Virginia
Tech.
Kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
had
been
the
third-most
accurate
kicker
in
the
nation
heading
into
the
Orange
Bowl,
having
hit
21
of
his
24
field
goal
attempts
during
the
season.[63]
He
only
needed
two
field
goals
to
break
Tech's
record
for
most
field
goals
in
the
season,
set
at
22
by
Shayne
Graham
in
1998.[63]
Though
Dunlevy
had
two
chances
for
field
goals,
one
fell
short
and
the
other
was
blocked.

On
defense,
the
Hokies
were
led
by
linebacker
Vince
Hall,
who
recorded
seven
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
one
pass
break-up.[64]
Hokies'
defender
Orion
Martin
also
had
a
big
game,
recording
six
solo
tackles,
one
assisted
tackle,
and
two
sacks
of
Kansas
quarterback
Todd
Reesing.
Two
other
defensive
players
recorded
one
sack
apiece,
and
D.J.
Parker
recorded
the
Hokies'
sole
interception
on
defense.[64]

Kansas
statistical
recap

On
offense,
the
Jayhawks
recorded
a
total
of
344
yards,
249
of
which
came
through
the
air.
Quarterback
Todd
Reesing
was
the
key
contributor
to
the
Kansas
aerial
attack,
completing
20
of
his
37
passes
for
227
yards
and
just
one
interception.[61]
The
only
other
Kansas
player
to
record
passing
yards
was
running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
who
threw
a
22-yard
first-down
pass
during
a
fake
punt.[61]
Though
under
pressure
for
much
of
the
game—Reesing
was
sacked
four
times—Kansas
continued
to
maintain
an
effective
pass
attack
throughout
the
game.[62]

Eight
different
receivers
caught
at
least
one
pass,
with
Dexton
Fields
leading
all
receivers
in
the
game
with
seven
catches
for
101
yards.[61]
Both
totals
were
the
highest
marks
recorded
in
the
game
by
either
team.
Fields
was
also
the
recipient
of
a
play
that
tied
for
the
longest
pass
play
of
the
game,
a
37-yard
toss
from
Reesing
halfway
through
the
third
quarter.[62]
Cornerback
and
game
MVP
Aqib
Talib
came
into
the
game
as
a
receiver
several
times,
but
because
his
appearance
in
the
game
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence,
the
Virginia
Tech
defense
was
able
to
zero
in
on
him
and
prevent
him
from
catching
the
ball.[62]

The
Jayhawks'
ground
game
was
less
effective
than
their
pass
offense,
but
still
had
success
against
a
tough
Virginia
Tech
defense.
Running
back
Brandon
McAnderson,
Kansas'
leading
rusher,
finished
the
game
with
15
carries
for
75
yards.
Backup
running
back
Jake
Sharp
rushed
nine
times
for
33
yards,
including
several
key
first-down
runs.[61]

As
successful
as
Kansas'
offense
was,
it
was
the
Jayhawks'
special
teams
(beating
Virginia
Tech
coach
Frank
Beamer
at
his
own
game)
that
earned
them
the
victory.
Kansas
blocked
one
Virginia
Tech
field
goal,
and
caused
Tech
kicker
Jud
Dunlevy
to
miss
another
short.
Kansas
punter
Kyle
Tucker
did
an
excellent
job
pinning
Virginia
Tech
deep
in
its
own
end
of
the
field,
kicking
the
ball
five
times
for
a
total
of
250
yards,
averaging
50
yards
a
punt.
His
longest
punt,
a
62-yard
kick,
was
one
of
three
punts
that
were
downed
inside
Tech's
20-yard
line.[61]

The
Kansas
defense,
which
had
been
ill-regarded
heading
into
the
game,
performed
well,
as
MVP
Aqib
Talib
finished
the
game
with
five
tackles
in
addition
to
the
interception
that
he
returned
for
a
touchdown.[64]
The
Jayhawks'
leading
tackler
was
Mike
Rivera,
who
earned
12
tackles,
including
one
sack
of
quarterback
Sean
Glennon.
Altogether,
the
Jayhawks
sacked
Virginia
Tech's
quarterbacks
five
times,
including
two
sacks
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
game.[64]

Postgame
effects

Kansas'
victory
in
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
had
far-reaching
effects
for
both
Virginia
Tech
and
Kansas
as
well
as
college
football
teams
around
the
country.
The
victory
allowed
Kansas
to
finish
its
2007
season
with
a
final
record
of
12–1,
while
the
loss
brought
Virginia
Tech
to
a
final
record
of
11–3.
The
game
itself
provided
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
economic
impact
for
the
South
Florida
region,
which
attracted
tens
of
thousands
of
visitors
from
both
Virginia
and
Kansas.[65]
In
Kansas,
bars
and
liquor
stores
benefited
from
the
game,
as
Jayhawks'
fans
stocked
up
on
food
and
alcohol
for
the
game.[66]

A
bet
on
the
game
between
the
governors
of
Kansas
and
Virginia
was
resolved
when
Virginia
Governor
Tim
Kaine
sent
a
Virginia
smoked
ham
to
the
Kansas
state
capitol.[67]
Had
Virginia
Tech
won,
Kansas
Governor
Kathleen
Sebelius
would
have
sent
Kaine
an
assortment
of
Kansas
beef.[68]

Virginia
Tech

The
Hokies'
loss
to
Kansas
lowered
its
bowl
winning
percentage
since
1993
to
40
percent.
In
the
15
bowl
games
played
between
the
1993
Independence
Bowl
and
the
2008
Orange
Bowl,
the
Hokies
amassed
a
record
of
six
wins
and
nine
losses.
Despite
the
loss
to
the
Jayhawks
and
the
loss
of
several
graduating
players,
Virginia
Tech
was
a
popular
pick
to
repeat
as
ACC
champions
heading
into
the
off-season.[69]
The
seniors
who
graduated
following
the
Orange
Bowl
game
were
the
winningest
team
in
Virginia
Tech
history,
becoming
one
of
just
three
teams
in
Division
I
to
win
at
least
10
games
each
of
the
previous
four
years.
Junior
Sean
Glennon's
second
consecutive
failure
to
win
a
bowl
game,
however,
re-opened
the
question
of
whether
he
or
Tyrod
Taylor
would
be
the
Hokies'
starter
at
quarterback
in
2008.[70]

Kansas

Kansas'
victory
over
Virginia
Tech
was
the
Jayhawks'
fifth
bowl
victory
and
was
the
11th
bowl
game
in
the
history
of
the
Kansas
Jayhawks
football
team.
Because
of
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
Jayhawks'
success,
some
pundits
proclaimed
the
2008
Orange
Bowl
as
ranking
among
the
greatest
Kansas
sports
victories
of
all
time.[71]
The
game
paid
$17
million
to
Kansas
and
the
Big
12
Conference
and
helped
to
boost
the
Kansas
football
team's
national
profile
among
potential
recruits.
In
addition,
the
bowl
appearance
assisted
the
Kansas
Athletic
Department's
fundraising
efforts.[72]

2008
NFL
Draft

The
2008
Orange
Bowl
provided
an
excellent
national
platform
for
players
from
both
Kansas
and
Virginia
Tech
to
impress
National
Football
League
scouts
prior
to
the
2008
NFL
Draft,
held
April
26
and
April
27,
2008.
Virginia
Tech
cornerback
Brandon
Flowers
was
one
of
the
first
Orange
Bowl
participants
to
announce
his
intent
to
enter
the
draft
following
the
game.
Flowers,
a
redshirt
junior,
finished
the
season
with
five
interceptions.[73]

Two
Kansas
players
announced
that
they
would
leave
early
for
the
NFL.
Aqib
Talib,
the
game's
MVP,
and
All-American
Anthony
Collins
announced
they
would
enter
the
2008
draft,
capitalizing
on
their
successful
season.[74]

In
total,
eight
Virginia
Tech
players
would
be
drafted
that
year,
along
with
four
Kansas
players.
